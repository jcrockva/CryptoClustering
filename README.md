Crypto Clustering
I loaded and explored cryptocurrency market data, standardized it, and performed K-Means clustering to group similar coins. 
Next I optimized the number of clusters using the Elbow Method, identifying 4 as the best value for k. 
Then I applied PCA to reduce dimensionality and repeated clustering, confirming the same result (4 clusters). 
Lastly I visualized and compared clustering outcomes before and after PCA, showing the same cluster patterns with fewer features.
